# Blog Post Guide

This guide explains how to create and manage blog posts in this Astro-based portfolio website.

## Creating a New Blog Post

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `src/content/blog` directory
2. Use the following frontmatter template:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A brief description of your post"
pubDate: "2024-03-21"
heroImage: "/images/blog/your-image.jpg"
tags: ["category1", "category2"]
---

Your blog post content here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

- `title`: The title of your blog post
- `description`: A brief summary of your post (used in previews)
- `pubDate`: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `heroImage`: Path to the hero image (relative to the `public` directory)
- `tags`: Array of categories/tags for the post

## Managing Categories

Categories are automatically generated from the `tags` field in your blog posts' frontmatter.

### Adding Categories

1. Add tags to your post's frontmatter:

```markdown
tags: ["Web Development", "JavaScript", "Astro"]
```

2. Categories will automatically appear in the sidebar

### Best Practices for Categories

- Use consistent naming (e.g., "Web Development" vs "web-development")
- Keep categories broad and meaningful
- Use 2-3 categories per post maximum
- Consider using existing categories before creating new ones

## Adding Images

1. Place your images in the `public/images/blog` directory
2. Reference them in your frontmatter:

```markdown
heroImage: "/images/blog/your-image.jpg"
```

### Image Guidelines

- Recommended size: 1200x630 pixels
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Max file size: 500KB
- Use descriptive filenames

## Writing Content

- Use Markdown for formatting
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting:
  ````markdown
  ```javascript
  const example = "code here";
  ```
  ````
- Add images within content:
  ```markdown
  ![Alt text](/images/blog/content-image.jpg)
  ```

## Previewing Posts

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Visit `http://localhost:4321/blog` to see your posts

## Deployment

Posts are automatically built and deployed with the site. No additional steps needed!
