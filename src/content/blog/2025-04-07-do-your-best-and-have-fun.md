Hey dudes,

So, today I wanted to write about something super important, something you’ve heard me say… well, pretty much your whole lives. It’s that little phrase: “Do your best and have fun!”

You know, sometimes life can feel like a big game, or maybe even a bit like trying to solve a really tricky computer puzzle. There are rules, there are challenges, and sometimes it feels like everyone else knows the secret cheat codes except you.

I remember back when I was just starting to really get into computers. There were so many things I didn't understand! It felt like everyone else was speaking a language I hadn’t learned yet, especially that we couldn’t afford a computer and I had to save up every little bit of extra money just to go to a computer shop. I could have gotten really frustrated, focused only on getting everything “right” the first time. But I persisted and tried to find a way to make it fun because sometimes it is about putting in the effort, trying your hardest, but also remembering to enjoy the process.

For me, that meant not getting bogged down in every single error message that popped up on the screen. It meant celebrating the small victories, like finally getting that piece of code to work, even if it took a while! It meant sharing the excitement with others who were also learning, even when we were all making silly mistakes.

That’s what “do your best” means to me. It’s not about being perfect or always winning. It’s about putting in the effort you can, using your brain and your energy to try and figure things out. It’s about not giving up easily, even when things get tough.

But the second part, “and have fun!” is just as crucial. Because what’s the point of doing anything if you’re not enjoying it at least a little bit? Life’s too short to be miserable while you’re learning or working on something. Having fun can actually make you better at things! When you’re curious and enjoying yourself, you’re more likely to experiment, to try new things, and even to learn from your mistakes without getting too down on yourself.

Remember those times you brought home awards from school? Not always the ones for the highest grades but I was always so incredibly proud of those “Most Curious” and “Most Innovative” awards. To me, those showed that you were engaging with the world around you, asking questions, and trying to create new things. Hopefully, having a blast while doing it! That’s way more valuable than just memorizing facts to get a good grade.

So, as you go through life, whether it’s learning a new video game, trying to build something cool with LEGOs, or even tackling those school assignments, remember to put in your best effort, be curious, be innovative… and don’t forget to have some fun along the way. That’s the real secret to a good life, I think.

Moving forward, I will be sharing to you guys my journey to whatever I will be doing that is tech-related, hoping to help you explore and enjoy the tech-world.elped you learn something new?

‘til next time,
